## ***Background Context***
Pong - a classic game that defined an era, is now your canvas for reinvention. As the architect of the next chapter in gaming history, it’s your mission to inject a breath of fresh air into this timeless piece. Let’s venture forth and give Pong a modern makeover with Pong 2.0! 🕹️🚀

Building upon the foundations set by gaming legends like Allan Alcorn and Ted Dabney, you’ve grasped the basics of Unity, C#, game physics, AI, and user input. Now, it’s time to leave your own imprint on the gaming landscape. 🏗️ 🎮

Your quest now is to personalize Pong into a game of your own design. Imbue this gaming classic with your own style and ideas, introducing novel mechanics and gameplay elements that could redefine the way we perceive Pong. 🏓👾

It’s time to get your creative juices flowing. How about introducing novel power-ups, multiple balls, rotating paddles, or even - snakes?! 🎊 Are there new themes or aesthetic approaches to be explored? 💡

The future of Pong is in your hands. Craft your version, pixel by pixel!🎨

## ***Technical Description***
This project encapsulates multiple key areas:

1. ***Custom Gameplay***: Innovate and introduce your own game mechanics that will provide a unique twist to the original Pong gameplay.
2. ***Evolved AI***: Expand the AI system, introducing more complexity and unpredictability to the opponent’s paddle behavior.
3. ***Artistic Direction***: Design and incorporate your own game assets, crafting a personalized look and feel for your version of Pong.
4. ***User Experience***: Focus on fine-tuning the user interface and controls, ensuring an intuitive and engaging gameplay experience.
5. ***Game Juicing***: Elevate the gaming experience by implementing responsive, engaging, and visually appealing 2D animations,
Beyond these core facets, you are encouraged to let your imagination run wild and integrate other features that enhance the game.

You will be using your previous codebase from the Unity 1 project as your starting point for this project.

Requirements
General
Include a README.md file at the root of the project directory
Employ Unity’s default .gitignore in your holbertonschool-unity-pong directory
Push the entire project folder pong-two to your repo
Ensure all project assets (such as Scenes, Scripts, Materials, etc.) are organized as per the tasks outlined.
Include ample comments and markup in your scripts to clarify functionality, flag bugs, and enhance readability.
